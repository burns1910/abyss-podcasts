# Content-Gate for SoundCloud

This project was planned as a content-gate for SoundCloud tailored for the [Abyss-Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/abyss_hamburg).

Means that artists on SoundCloud can define criterias (eg. follow their channel, liking their track, etc.) as an requirement. 
By fulfilling this requirements the listener will get some content in return. In this paricular case it is the tracklist of a set.

It was planned to use the SoundCloud API for checking and handling the requirements.
Unfortunately SoundCloud stopped the registration for new users of the API, so that this project has to be paused.

Used Technologies: React, Airtable, Serverless Functions (JAM-Stack)
